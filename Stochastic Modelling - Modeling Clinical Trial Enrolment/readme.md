# Introduction
This project aims to analyze a dataset related to hospital patient counts and explore the suitability of 
count models for this type of data. The dataset contains information on the number of patients in different hospitals, 
and we will assess whether the data can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed. 
We will also examine the sample mean and sample variance to gain insights into the potential count model for the data.

# Objective
1. Evaluate the assumption of independence and identical distribution for the data.
2. Analyze the sample mean and sample variance to determine the appropriateness of a count model.
3. Fit a Poisson-Gamma model to the data using the method of moments and estimate the model parameters.
4. Fit the Poisson-Gamma model using maximum likelihood estimation and provide 95% confidence intervals for the model parameters.
5. Utilize the model fitted in Part 3 to calculate the expected number of hospitals with zero patients in a sample of n = 100, and draw conclusions based on the findings.
6. Calculate the probability mass function of a zero-truncated Poisson-Gamma model.
7. Fit the zero-truncated Poisson-Gamma model to the data using maximum likelihood estimation and analyze the model parameter estimates.
8. Compare the models from Parts 4 and 7 and interpret the implications of the comparison.
9. Determine which model is better suited for the data and provide justification for the choice.
