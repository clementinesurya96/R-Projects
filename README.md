# R-Projects Compilation Repository 

Welcome to my **R-Projects Compilation Repository**! This repository contains a collection of projects focused on exploratory data analysis, statistical machine learning, multivariate analysis, and machine learning tasks. Each project showcases the application of the R programming language in data-driven tasks.

### Please refer to the PDF document version in each folders for insights and visualizations

## ðŸŒŸ Project Structure and Overview

The repository is organized into separate directories, each representing a specific project. Within each project directory, you'll find:

- **Data**: Datasets used in the project.
- **Code**: R scripts and notebooks demonstrating implementation of techniques for data collection, data cleaning and preparation, data transformation and feature engineering, data analysis (building statistical model using data science and machine learning techniques), and deriving insights and visualizations.
- **Documentation**: Project summaries, methodologies, and analysis reports.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore a project:
1. Go to its directory.
2. Follow instructions in the project-specific README file for environment setup, dataset acquisition, and code execution.

Happy exploring and learning with R! ðŸŽ‰
