# Indoor Scene Recognition: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models

### Introduction
The purpose of this report is to explore and compare various deep learning systems for indoor scene recognition 
using dataset consists of images representing different rooms and locations commonly found in a standard family home
The objective is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying the type of indoor scene depicted in the images.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains a subset of a larger dataset specifically curated for indoor scene recognition. 
It encompasses images categorized into ten classes: bathroom, bedroom, children_room, closet, corridor, dining_room, garage, kitchen, living_room, 
and stairs. The dataset is divided into three sets: train, validation, and test. 
The training set contains images with varying scene types, ranging from 52 to 367 images per scene. 
The validation and test sets are approximately half the size of the training set.

### Methodology
#### Model Selection and Configuration
To address the indoor scene recognition task, we will deploy four distinct deep learning systems. 
These systems may consist of different types of architectures, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Each deep learning system will be characterized by unique configurations, hyperparameters, and training settings. 
The choices made in defining these systems will be clearly motivated. The following factors will be considered:
- Architecture: The selection of suitable neural network architectures, including the number of hidden units, layer configurations, and activation functions.
- Regularization: The implementation of regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent overfitting.
- Kernel and Filter Size: Choosing appropriate kernel and filter sizes for CNN-based models to capture relevant spatial features.
- Optimization: Evaluating different optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam, to optimize model performance.
- Hyperparameters: Tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, for each deep learning system.

#### Comparative Analysis and Model Evaluation
The deep learning systems will be compared based on their training and predictive performance. The following metrics will be considered:
- Accuracy: The overall classification accuracy of each model on the validation set.
- Loss: The training and validation loss values to assess model convergence and generalization.
- Computational Efficiency: Evaluation of training time and resource requirements for each system.
- Interpretability: Analyzing the interpretability of the models and their ability to capture meaningful features.

#### Selection of the Best Model
Based on the comparative analysis, the best-performing model in terms of both training and predictive performance will be selected. 
The model that exhibits the highest accuracy, lowest loss, optimal computational efficiency, and desirable interpretability will be chosen as the 
most effective model for indoor scene recognition.

### Test Data Evaluation
#### Performance Assessment
The test data will be utilized to evaluate the predictive performance of the selected model. 
The model's ability to accurately recognize and classify the different indoor scenes will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.

#### Scene Recognition Analysis
An analysis of the model's ability to recognize and differentiate between various indoor scenes will be provided. This analysis will highlight the strengths and limitations of the model in identifying the different room types represented in the test dataset.
